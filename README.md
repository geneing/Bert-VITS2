## 【Project Introduction】
# The new autoregressive TTS under FishAudio, [Fish-Speech](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech), is now available. It achieves the current open-source SOTA level and is continuously maintained. It is recommended to use this project as a replacement for BV2/GSV. This project will not be maintained in the short term.

## Tech slides Video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zJ4m1K7cj
## Please note, the core idea of this project comes from [anyvoiceai/MassTTS](https://github.com/anyvoiceai/MassTTS), a very good tts project
## MassTTS's demo is [AI version of Feng Ge's sharp review of himself, and finding back his lost kidney in the Golden Triangle](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w24y1c7z9)

[//]: # (This repository originated from a friend sharing a video of AI Feng Ge, I was amazed by the effect, and after trying MassTTS, I found that fs has a certain gap in sound quality compared to vits, and the training pipeline is more complex than vits, therefore, following its idea, bert)
